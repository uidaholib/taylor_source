For more information about the Taylor Wilderness Research Center see: http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/taylor","This is the first Taylor Ranch log book in the University of Idaho's digital archives. The log book begins in July of 1997 and the last entry is dated February 28th, 1999. It begins with an entry by Holly Akenson explaining the appointment by University of Idaho her and her husband (Jim Akenson) received as Taylor Ranch managers. Holly mentions their previous tenure at the ranch from 1982 to 1990 and that this was their return to the ranch after 7 years of working as ""wildlife biologists"" in LaGrande, Oregon. The log book details the day-to-day lives of the Akenson's at Taylor Ranch including their work life as wildlife biologists, their daily ranch chores, and various insights into the wilderness that the Taylor Ranch inhabits. Amongst the detailing of their day-to-day lives at the Taylor Ranch, the Akenson's provide various significant insights about the evolution of the Taylor Ranch. During the timeline of this log book, there is no stable electricity. Though readers can learn of the first implementation of hydro-electric power and the first day of hydro-electric lighting for the Akenson's cabin. In fact, there are quite a few detailed accounts of alternative sources of energy being used at the cabin including solar electricity. The Akenson's also detail the weather patterns of the area as well as their wildlife findings. The wildlife findings include information such as migration patterns, wildlife pregnancy, predation reports, and uncommon wildlife sightings. There are also accounts from the Akenson's on utilizing the Taylor Ranch as an educational resource for University of Idaho students. Aside from the wilderness aspect of these log books, the Akenson's provide fruitful insights into the development of technology and the usage for wilderness research accordingly. Readers and purveyor's today will notice technology devices that have been vastly outdated and some early technological implementations in such an isolated area.

Technology is also accounted for as the Taylor Ranch receives a DirectTV satellite system and various upgrades to computers.

The Akenson's wildlife biology work continues as well with predation reports, pregnancy reports, and migration patterns. Weather patterns also continue as Holly writes out yearly NWS weather reports for the area. There is also a new caretaker that arrives to relieve the Akenson's for a break. This caretaker, Ken Hobson, was a senior at University of Idaho and spent two summers prior as an intern. Hobson relieves the Akenson's in December so they might go on vacation and there is a new perspective in the log book of somebody who has already spent time with the Taylor Ranch community and is now trusted with taking care of the Taylor Ranch. As many will remember, the year 2001 was a pivotal year in contemporary United States history because of the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001. Holly Akenson recounts the backcountry radio alerting her to turn on her TV and find out about the attacks of 9/11. What follows is Holly's own perspective and insights into how the nation handled the attacks and the media as well. Aside from the current events of 2001, the Akenson's also confront the one year anniversary of the massive wildfires from the previous year which riddled the backcountry of Idaho. The log book also contains an interesting finding of spear points in the backcountry and a couple of finals given to visiting students of the Taylor Ranch.
