        <h1>About the MosCon Program Collection</h1>
        
        <p>MosCon was a vibrant regional science fiction convention based in Moscow, Idaho. This collection provides access to MosCon program booklets for the twenty-two annual conventions held from 1979 to 2001.</p>

        <p>The programs make up a small part of the Victoria E. Mitchell Collection (MG 470), donated to University of Idaho Library <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/">Special Collections and Archives</a> in 2017. The initial 325-box science fiction collection includes science fiction and fantasy artwork, illustrations and posters; science fiction memorabilia; clothing and costumes; records pertaining to local and regional science fiction organizations; manuscripts; and a large science fiction book collection that includes approximately 5,000 volumes.</p>
        
        <p>Victoria E. Mitchell was U of I alumna, longtime Moscow resident, and published science fiction writer. Her husband Jon Gustafson was a writer and well-known science fiction and fantasy art expert and memorabilia appraiser. He founded the first professional science fiction/fantasy art and book appraisal service in North America. Victoria and Jon were members of the Palouse Empire Science Fiction Association and early organizers of MosCon.</p>
